# HealthCare.AI 🩺🤖

**HealthCare.AI** is a medical assistant powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), built to help users query and understand their medical reports. It currently supports text-based document analysis using advanced LLMs like Google Gemini or a custom LLM API wrapper, and is designed for easy extension into multimodal and agentic capabilities.

## 🚀 Features

- 📄 **Text-Based Medical Report QA**  
  Users can ask questions related to their uploaded medical reports and get reliable answers generated by the LLM.

- 🔍 **RAG Architecture**  
  Combines vector-based semantic retrieval (via FAISS) with LLMs for accurate and context-aware responses.

- 🧠 **LLM Flexibility**  
  Supports both Google Gemini and a custom LLM API wrapper to allow flexible back-end deployment.

## 🧪 Tech Stack

- `Python`
- `Streamlit` (for UI)
- `FAISS` (for vector database)
- `Google Gemini / Custom LLM API`
- `PyMuPDF / PDFPlumber` (for medical PDF parsing)
- `Tiktoken` (for token counting and chunking)
